You can use the project in several ways.

- Development mode

```

This will open your browser with the following url [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), there you can play with the project, also this command will start a fake server running the project api at the url [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001). In short words, this command will run the client and the server side of the project.

- Production mode

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate a bundle files for the client to put it in a real server.

This command will run the server side, but to be honest, this is only a fake server that use the json-server package.
